# Program-to-generate-cipher-text-from-plain-text
>> ### This is the simplest program to encrypt & decrypt any plain text containing capital alphabets, small alphabets & blank spaces (Excluding special-characters & numbers)
+ This program is writen in Python 3.7 and requires Python version 3.0 or later for execution
+ **[Caesar-Cipher ](https://github.com/CodeWithChirag/Program-to-generate-cipher-text-from-plain-text/blob/master/Caesar-Cipher.py)**
is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
